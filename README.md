# countries-app-backend

- This is my practice of doing the backend of the countries-app.
- In the orginal project, I started with front-end and did the backend with Node.js, Express.js and SQL.
- I am doing this project as purely backend and starting with countries-data from data.js and using MongoDB atlas NoSQL.
